#if the inputs are unclear in a program run the following
# import sys
#
# for line in sys.stdin:
#     print(f"Received line: {line.strip()}")
#The above will print if the inputs are one input or multiple
#so the day 6 inputs were 3 separate inputs so i need to use 3 inputs, one for int and n for each nth string


#Day 6 of 30 days of code
#creat a program that takes in an int of how many words will be entere and for
# each word, print the even and odd letter as a space separated string
# ex. 2, hacker, rank prints hce akr rn ak
# n = int(input())
# for i in range(n):
#     s = input()
#     print(f"{s[::2]} {s[1::2]}")
